# Tool Rental POS System

## Features
- **Tool Inventory Management**: Rent tools like ladders, chainsaws, and jackhammers with attributes such as tool code, type, brand, and daily rental charges.
- **Rental Agreement Generation**: Automatically generates a detailed agreement including tool details, rental period, chargeable days, pre-discount charges, discounts, and final charges.
- **Holiday Handling**: Supports Independence Day (observed if it falls on a weekend) and Labor Day (first Monday in September).
- **Flexible Charging Rules**: Tools may have different charging rules for weekdays, weekends, and holidays.
- **Validation**: Throws user-friendly exceptions for invalid inputs such as rental days less than 1 or discounts outside the range 0â€“100.
